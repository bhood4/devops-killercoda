* **Step 2**: Testing HTTP API Functionality
* **Step 3**: Basic Blackbox Testing
* **Step 4**: Custom HTTP Blackbox Module
* **Step 5**: Prometheus Scrape Job
* **Step 6**: Configuration Load & Verification

Food for thought right from the start is that you are also able to form the following check types:
