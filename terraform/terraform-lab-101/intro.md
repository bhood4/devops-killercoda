[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source 
[infrastructure-as-code ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)
software tool created by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/).

This scenario will teach you the following basic Terraform concepts:

* [State File](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) - How Terraform maps real world resources to your configuration
* [Backends](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/index.html) - How the state file is stored
* [Providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html) - How underlying infrastructure is abstracted away
* [Data Sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/data-sources.html) - How data can be fetched or computed for use in your configuration
* [Resources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html) - How infrastructure objects are defined
* [Variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) - Values to be reused throughout your configuration
